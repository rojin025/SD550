        Why is the block system so popular with our students? video block-system
        At MIU you never juggle 4-5 classes and homework at once. Instead,
        you’re immersed in only one full-time course each month. This is the
        block system. The block system allows you to easily learn more with less
        stress. And there’s no finals week!
